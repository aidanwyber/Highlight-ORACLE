# INTEGRAL FUTURE
### By Chloé van der Horst (NL)

Chloé seeks to investigate new directions to move into for contemporary art in this work by means of cognitive amplification techniques and resonant inductive coupling (wireless energy). The idea behind the work was sparked after Van der Horst was introduced to the "Digital Bugfest" project by Ruben van Esterik & ND&D during Highlight in 2023.
