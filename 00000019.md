# TRANS-ENVIRONMENTAL MUMMY PORN
### By Yordi van der Ven (NL)

Van der Ven attempts to emphasise the prosperity of the present as compared to the suffering of the past and to explore values of alternate futures. They make use of head transplant photography databases and a suggestively shaped solid-state battery. Van der Ven based much of their exploration on inspiration from "Urban Data Forest" by Highlight 2023 featured artist Grow Your Own Cloud.
