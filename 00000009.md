# DEEP LEARNING
### By Deborah Groen (NL)

Groen attempts to explore interactions with narcissists and to help pre-teens stay young. Sie makes use of lenses to concentrate solar power and solar-powered Lo-Ra nodes scattered across Delft. The idea behind the work was sparked after Groen was introduced to the "Growing Light" project by Tim van Dortmont during Highlight in 2021.
