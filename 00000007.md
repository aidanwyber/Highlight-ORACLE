# INTER-POETIC, MINDFUL SWEXIT & TUNDRA
### By Mathieu Post (NL)

This project scheduled for 2031 by Mathieu Post aims to explore values of alternate futures and to evoke resentment of certain state officials by using traditional Tantric initiation ceremonies. The idea behind the work was sparked after Post was introduced to the "Binaural Audio Art" project by Armand Lesceq during Highlight in 2023.
